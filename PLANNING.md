# Project Planning: Discord Translator Bot

---

## Vision & Goals

Build a high-quality, production-ready Discord bot that enables seamless multilingual communication across servers and channels, powered by LLMs, with a focus on modularity, testability, and excellent documentation.

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Language:** Node.js (TypeScript)
- **Core Components:**
  - Discord bot client
  - Channel bridging module
  - Translation service abstraction (supports multiple LLM providers)
  - Reaction-based translation handler
  - Configuration storage (SQLite initially, PostgreSQL planned)
  - Admin command interface
- **Design Principles:**
  - Modular, feature-based folder structure
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Dependency injection where applicable
  - Environment-based configuration
  - Automated testing and CI/CD integration

---

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js (latest LTS)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Package Manager:** Yarn
- **Database:** SQLite (initial), PostgreSQL (future)
- **ORM:** Prisma or Knex.js (TBD)
- **LLM API:** OpenAI-compatible endpoints (local or cloud)
- **Testing:** Jest
- **Linting:** ESLint + Prettier
- **Documentation:** Markdown, Typedoc
- **Containerization:** Docker

---

## Constraints

- Avoid vendor lock-in for LLM providers.
- Keep secrets secure; do not expose API keys in code or prompts.
- Maintain compatibility with Discord API updates.
- Keep individual source files under 500 lines; refactor as needed.
- Prioritize clear, maintainable code with inline comments and docstrings.

---

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the task management workflow in `TASKS.md`.
- Write unit tests for every new feature or function.
- Update documentation continuously.
- Use environment variables for secrets and configuration.
- Containerize the app for deployment.
- Use MCP servers and AI assistants responsibly, following `.rooignore` exclusions.

---

## Future Considerations

- Web dashboard for configuration
- Multi-cloud LLM provider support
- Analytics and monitoring
- Localization of bot responses
- Advanced permission controls
