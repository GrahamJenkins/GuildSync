## Testing Policies

- **Framework:** Use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for all unit and integration tests.
- **Coverage:** Every function/module must have tests covering:
  - At least one expected success case
  - At least one edge case
  - At least one intentional failure/error case
- **Mocking:** Mock all external services (Discord API, LLM APIs, databases) to ensure tests are deterministic.
- **Location:** Place tests in a `/tests` directory mirroring the source structure.
- **Automation:** Tests must pass before merging any pull request.
- **Continuous Integration:** Integrate tests with CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions).
- **Test Data:** Avoid using real secrets or API keys in tests; use environment variables or mocks.
